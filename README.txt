HP Printer Monitor
----
This application is used to scan printers on a network and detect if there is problems with the printer.
The application was designed for easy expansion and portability. Plus, designed with minimal code editing required.

The brains of the application comes from a Printer.txt file. (Example is in the root repository)
This file is to contain the network printers and any computers that should auto-scan with application start.
This file is defaulted detected in "C:\Temp\Printers.txt", but can be changed to anything via Shortcut Argument Pass . (Example is found in the root repository)

If you wish to change the FavIco, than you will have to recompile the code putting in place the Ico you would like to use.
Keep in mind the application launches as a tray icon, so double check there if you think it is not running.

ENJOY!
